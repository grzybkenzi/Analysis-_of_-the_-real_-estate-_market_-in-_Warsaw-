# Analysis of the real estate market in Warsaw 
The purpose of the project is to explore the secondary market of flats in Warsaw. My work is based on the Kaggle real estate dataset containing data from Otodom, the most popular real estate website in Poland. The dataset contains a listing of all flats available to buy on the secondary market in Warsaw in October 2022. The first part of the project involves carring out statistical analyses for the city as a whole and for each urban district.
It answers the questions:
- What is the median price (expressed in PLN / m²) for all flats listed for sale in Warsaw? 
- What is the median size of flats (expressed in square metres) listed for sale in Warsaw ?
- Flats with how many rooms dominate the market?
- In which district are the most flat offers?
- What are the median prices (expressed in PLN / m²) for the different city districts?
- What are the median areas of flats (expressed in square metres) for the different city districts?

The next part of the project focuses on building and performing a linear regression model to predict flat prices. This part involves selecting appropriate predictors, fitting the model to the data and calculating the accuracy of the model. This project is for educational purposes only and aims to demonstrate my coding and analytical skills.
